<h1>Bruter :: SNMP</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The SNMP module tests accounts against SNMP service. This module supports 
only SNMP version 2c. This version uses only community string as a password. 
So you should clear "User" input field and set "Dictionary" input field to a 
filename that contains SNMP community strings.</p>

<p>There are READ-ONLY, READ-WRITE and WRITE-ONLY access level. This program 
tests READ capability first. If the program found a community string that can 
read a value, then it tests WRITE capability. While testing WRITE capability, 
the program will write the same value that it got from testing READ capability. 
This program will not test WRITE-ONLY access level, because I cannot find a way to test 
WRITE-ONLY without changing the value on a server.</p>

<p>The result from this module has a "note". The below is a complete description of the "note"</p>
<ul>
<li>ro - read only permission</li>
<li>rw - read write permission</li>
</ul>

<p>"Time out" is an important value for this protocol because a login result is 
determined whether server responds or not</p>

<p>Note: This program tests READ and WRITE capability with sysContact MIB.</p>
<p>Note: Since SNMP is a UDP-based protocol, a server will send a response 
only if we send a correct community string.</p>
