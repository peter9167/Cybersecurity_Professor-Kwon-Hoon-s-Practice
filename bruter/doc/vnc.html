<h1>Bruter :: VNC</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The VNC module tests accounts against VNC service. Now it supports only VNC authentication.</p>

<p>Note: "Max Attempt/Connection" is ignored because this protocol allows only one attempt per connection.</p>
<p>Note: Some VNC server, such as RealVNC, has implemented the IP blacklist if the authentication fails many times</p>

<h2>Option(s)</h2>
<p>Not available</p>
